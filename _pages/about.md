The main focus of my research is the study of how our galaxy formed and evolved using the chemical evolution point of view. More thorough research aims to investigate and distinguish the chemical abundances in various environments, from the dwarf galaxies in the halo to the Galaxy bulge passing through accreted populations.

As part of the APOGEE and 4MOST, I work studying the Milky Way to define constraints in the galactic regions. As part of the science team of CUBES-VLT and MOSAIC-ELT, I have been developing several simulations to evaluate these instruments' performance in Galactic archaeology.
