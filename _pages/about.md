The main focus of the research are the oldest stars in the Galactic bulge, in particular field and globular cluster metal-poor stars. These objects carry information on the first massive stars that exploded as supernovae in the early Galaxy, thus constraining the early phases of the Galaxy formation and evolution. A more thorough research aims to investigate and distinguish the chemical abundances in a variety of environments, from the halo to the Galaxy bulge.

As part of the APOGEE group we are working with the H-band infra-red survey to independently select and analyse the stars in the Galactic bulge to define constraints in this galactic region. As part of the science team of CUBES-VLT and MOSAIC-ELT, I have been developing several simulations to evaluate the performance of these instruments in the field of galaxy archaeology.
